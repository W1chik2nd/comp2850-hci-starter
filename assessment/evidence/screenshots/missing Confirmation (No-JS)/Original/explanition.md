**Comparison: Delete Confirmation Behavior**

- **Left (JS Enabled)**: A browser-native confirmation dialog ("Are you sure?") appears, preventing accidental deletion.
- **Right (No-JS Mode)**: No confirmation dialog is shown. The task is deleted immediately upon clicking the button, increasing the risk of error.
