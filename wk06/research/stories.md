# Job Stories — Research Findings

## Story S1: Quick Search & Filter
**Situation**: When I have a long list of tasks and need to find a specific one
**Motivation**: I want to filter the list instantly by typing a keyword
**Outcome**: So I can find what I need without scrolling through irrelevant items
**Underlying need**: Because scanning long lists is cognitively draining and inefficient

## Story S2: Inline Editing
**Situation**: When I spot a typo or error in a task title while reviewing my list
**Motivation**: I want to fix it right there without loading a separate "edit page"
**Outcome**: So I can correct mistakes immediately and stay in my workflow
**Underlying need**: Because context switching (navigation) breaks my focus and feels heavy

## Story S3: Keyboard Accessibility
**Situation**: When I cannot use a mouse (due to disability or preference)
**Motivation**: I want to add, edit, and delete tasks using only the keyboard (Tab/Enter)
**Outcome**: So I can use the application fully without physical barriers
**Underlying need**: Because relying solely on pointing devices excludes me from using the tool
