# Job Stories — Week 6 Needs-Finding

## Story S1: Add Task Confirmation
**Situation**: When I add a new task to my list
**Motivation**: I want immediate visual feedback that the task was successfully added
**Outcome**: So I don't have to scroll down or search to verify it's there
**Underlying need**: Because uncertainty about whether an action worked causes anxiety and breaks my flow

## Story S2: Delete Task Safety
**Situation**: When I delete a completed task
**Motivation**: I want a clear confirmation or undo option
**Outcome**: So I don't accidentally lose important information
**Underlying need**: Because fear of accidental data loss makes me hesitant to clean up my list

## Story S3: Keyboard Navigation
**Situation**: When I'm using the app without a mouse (e.g., in a cramped space or due to RSI)
**Motivation**: I want to access all interactive elements using only the keyboard
**Outcome**: So I can complete my work efficiently without pain or frustration
**Underlying need**: Because physical constraints shouldn't block me from using the tool
